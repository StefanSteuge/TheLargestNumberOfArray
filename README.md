How to find largest number in an array in Java?
Itâ€™s simple. You need to declare an array at the begging of the program. 

The program would scan the code using the for loop and would conclude its result(the largest number) from the array that has been declared initially. 

Refer the coed snippet below:

1
arr[]= {5, 45,20,80,4,160,90,86}
Output: 160
